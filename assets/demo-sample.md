# Speed Reading with RSVP

Welcome to **rsvp-term**, a terminal-based speed reading application.

## How It Works

RSVP stands for *Rapid Serial Visual Presentation*. Words appear one at a time at a fixed position, eliminating the need for eye movement across the page.

The **red letter** you see is the Optimal Recognition Point - where your eye naturally focuses when reading a word.

## Features

This tool supports:

- Markdown formatting with **bold** and *italic* text
- Code snippets like `cargo build`
- Multiple heading levels for navigation
- Adaptive timing for punctuation and long words

## Tips for Speed Reading

Start at a comfortable pace. Use `k` to speed up and `j` to slow down. Most people can read at 300-500 words per minute with practice.

> The average person reads at about 200-250 WPM. With RSVP, you can potentially double that rate!

## Getting Started

Press `Space` to pause or resume. Press `o` to see the document outline. Press `?` for help.

Happy reading!
